# How to use embeds

**Adding market embeds to your Substack or website.**

Polymarket allows you to embed a live-updating widget displaying the latest odds for markets in many places around the web.

### Web
Navigate to the individual market you want to embed and click the embed (< >) link.

Select light or dark mode, and copy the auto-generated code
Paste the code into your code editor or CMS and publish as normal

### Twitter / X

Navigate to any Polymarket market
Copy the URL from your browser
Paste the URL into the compose window

### Substack

<Note>The embeds feature currently supports single markets only (eg “USA to Win Most Gold Medals”, not “Most Gold Medals at Paris Olympics’) </Note>


To embed a market, navigate on Polymarket.com to the single market you want to embed and click “copy link.”

Navigate to your Substack editor and paste the link directly into the body of your newsletter. The editor will recognize the market and convert it to a widget that automatically refreshes with the latest odds.
