# Can I sell early

**Instant cash outs on Polymarket**

You may sell shares at any point before the market is resolved by either placing a market order to sell shares at the prevailing bid price in the orderbook, or by placing a limit order for how many shares you wish to sell and at what price. The limit order will only be executed if/when there is a willing buyer for your shares at the price you set.
