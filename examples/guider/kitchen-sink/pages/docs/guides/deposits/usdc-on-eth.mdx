Depositing USDC on the Ethereum network to Polymarket will automatically bridge your funds to the Polygon network.



1. On the Polymarket deposit page, under “Other Methods,” click **USDC (ETH)**.

3. Send your USDC to the address you just copied on the Ethereum network. This feature is typically called “send” or “withdraw” on most exchanges and wallets.

<Note>
Ensure you are sending USDC to your Polymarket Ethereum deposit address on Ethereum network to avoid any issues.
</Note>

4. Once your deposit is detected, a countdown timer will begin.

5. You will see "Deposit Complete" when your funds are ready to trade.

<Tip>If your countdown timer resets more than once, or if you encounter any issues, please reach out to support on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polymarket). </Tip>
