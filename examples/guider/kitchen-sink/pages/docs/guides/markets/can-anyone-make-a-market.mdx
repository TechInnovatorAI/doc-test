# Can I create my own market?

**Users cannot create their own markets, but are encouraged to suggest ideas for new markets.**

The best ways to suggest a new market are:

1. On Twitter / X by tagging [@polymarket](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I+have+an+idea+for+a+new+market+@polymarket)
2. On [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polymarket) in the **#market-suggestion** channel

To give your market suggestion the best chance of being listed, include as much information as possible, such as:

* Name of the market
* Evidence of demand for trading the market
* Does the market have any social or news value?
* What is the exact question the market will answer?
* What is the proposed source of resolution for the market?
