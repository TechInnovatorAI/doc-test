# How are markets clarified?


In rare cases, circumstances occur that were not foreseen at a market’s creation and it becomes necessary to clarify rules after trading has begun. In these cases Polymarket may issue an “Additional context” update to the rules.

If you believe a clarification is necessary for a market, the best place to request a clarification is in the (Polymarket Discord)[https://discord.com/invite/polymarket] **#market-review** channel.
