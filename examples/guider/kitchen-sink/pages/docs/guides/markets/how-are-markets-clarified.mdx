# How are markets clarified?


In rare cases, circumstances occur that were not foreseen at a market’s creation and it becomes necessary to clarify rules after trading has begun. In these cases Polymarket may issue an “Additional context” update to the rules.

If you believe a clarification is necessary for a market, the best place to request a clarification is in the (Polymarket Discord)[https://discord.com/invite/polymarket] **#market-review** channel.

The process works as follows:

1. Pre-Announcement. At least X hours before the clarification is issued, a bulletin board update will appear on the affected market alerting traders to the time of the incoming clarification.
2. Trading Suspended.
3. Clarification Issued. At the announced time, the clarification text will appear on the given market with the updated rule language.
4. Trading Resumed.
