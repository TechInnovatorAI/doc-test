# How are markets created?

**Markets are created by the markets team with input from users and the community.**

In choosing which markets to list, Polymarket considers the following factors:

- Is there enough demand for trading in the market to produce an accurate probability? Polymarket targets $X in trading volume as a minimum.
- Is there social good or news value in understanding the probability generated by the market?
- Can the market be resolved clearly?

 This is usually a “Yes” / “No” question like “Will Michelle Obama win the 2024 US Presidential Election?” or a multiple choice question like “At the September 2024 meeting, will the Federal Reserve a) leave rates unchanged; b) cut rates 25 bps; c) cut rates 50 bps, etc.”
- Is there a credible information source for market resolution?

For example, a country’s elections commission can be specified as the official resolution source for an election.

- Can the market be resolved in a definite time frame? Currently, markets are only created with a X-month time horizon.
